Different analysis of subgraphs of the Bitcoin network are done.

The jupyter notebook ``entropypathcentrality" contains some code to compute the path entropic centrality of nodes in a graph.

The jupyter notebook "principegraphclustering" contains some code to compute graph clustering using a quadratic Renyi entropy based evaluation function.
